/**	F4lmDoc provides a document object for a document-view model.
  *
  * The F4lmDoc class provides a document object that can be used in conjunction with the classes
  * F4lmApp and F4lmView to create a document-view model for MDI (Multiple Document Interface)
  * Qt applications based on QApplication and QMainWindow as main classes and QWorkspace as MDI manager widget.
  * Thereby, the document object is created by the F4lmApp instance (and kept in a document list) and contains
  * the document structure with the according methods for manipulating the document
  * data by F4lmView objects. Also, F4lmDoc contains the methods for serialization of the document data
  * from and to files.
